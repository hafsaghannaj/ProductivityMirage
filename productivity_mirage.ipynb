    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The prevailing market narrative holds that artificial intelligence will deliver a productivity boom analogous to the 1990s — implying that today's elevated equity multiples are justified by an incoming wave of disinflationary growth. **We believe this view is wrong, and dangerously so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1990s productivity miracle was not primarily a technology story. It was a *globalization* story. The integration of 800 million Chinese workers into the global labor force, combined with falling energy costs and post-Cold War fiscal restraint, created a once-in-history deflationary tailwind that amplified the impact of the internet revolution. Technology was the spark, but cheap globalization was the oxygen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, that oxygen is gone. The AI revolution is unfolding in a world of:\n",
    "- **Deglobalization and onshoring** (CHIPS Act, friend-shoring, tariff escalation)\n",
    "- **Structurally higher energy costs** (energy transition, underinvestment in hydrocarbons)\n",
    "- **Fiscal dominance** (debt/GDP >120%, persistent deficits, politicized monetary policy)\n",
    "- **Labor scarcity** (demographics, immigration restrictions, unionization)\n",
    "\n",
    "We systematize this thesis into a quantitative `ProductivityRegimeIndicator` that scores the macro environment on a scale from -1 (deflationary productivity regime, like the 1990s) to +1 (inflationary productivity regime, like today). We then show that equity multiples are historically sensitive to this indicator — and that current pricing implies a regime that does not exist.\n",

    "## Section 1: What Happened Then\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 1990 and 2000, the US experienced what many economists call the \"Great Moderation\" on steroids:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real GDP growth** averaged 3.8% per year\n",
    "- **Core PCE inflation** fell from ~5% to ~1.5%\n",
    "- **The federal budget** went from deficit to surplus\n",
    "- **The S&P 500** returned ~430% (total return)\n",
    "- **The Shiller CAPE** expanded from 17x to 44x\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard narrative attributes this to the internet and information technology. But technology adoption alone cannot explain the simultaneous decline in inflation. Productivity booms should increase *demand* as well as supply — the net effect on prices is ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "What made the 1990s unique was that technology-driven productivity gains were *reinforced* by three exogenous deflationary forces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **China's WTO accession process (1990s):** China's export prices fell relentlessly as hundreds of millions of workers moved from subsistence farming to manufacturing. This suppressed global goods prices directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy abundance:** Oil prices averaged ~$20/barrel through most of the 1990s. The Soviet collapse flooded markets with cheap energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fiscal consolidation:** The Clinton administration, working with a Republican Congress, eliminated the budget deficit. This kept real yields contained even as growth accelerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination was extraordinary: rising productivity + falling input costs + fiscal discipline = non-inflationary growth. The Fed could keep rates relatively low, and equity multiples expanded to reflect a perceived permanent shift in the economy's potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight: the 1990s multiple expansion was not a *technology* premium — it was a *globalization* premium.**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Section 2: What's Different Now\n",
    "\n",
    "Every structural tailwind of the 1990s has reversed:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | 1990s | 2020s |\n",
    "|--------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| China | Deflationary exporter, integrating into global supply chains | Strategic competitor, subject to tariffs and export controls |\n",
    "| Energy | $20/bbl oil, Soviet supply glut | Energy transition costs, OPEC+ discipline, underinvestment |\n",
    "| Fiscal | Budget surpluses by 1998 | Debt/GDP >120%, $2T+ deficits, no political will for consolidation |\n",
    "| Labor | Growing workforce, low unionization, immigration | Aging demographics, rising unionization, immigration restrictions |\n",
    "| Monetary | Independent Fed, credible inflation target | Fiscal dominance risk, politicization pressure |\n",
    "| Geopolitics | Unipolar US hegemony, \"peace dividend\" | Multipolar fragmentation, rising defense spending |\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that even if AI delivers *identical* productivity gains to the internet, the macro transmission mechanism is fundamentally different. Productivity gains in an inflationary environment get absorbed by rising input costs rather than flowing through to margin expansion and multiple re-rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical analogy:** The 1960s also saw rapid technological progress (space race, early computing, manufacturing automation). But because it occurred alongside fiscal expansion (Vietnam, Great Society) and tight labor markets, the productivity gains were inflated away. The S&P 500's real return from 1966 to 1982 was approximately *zero*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not predicting stagflation. We are arguing that the *composition* of the current macro regime means productivity gains will not translate into the disinflation and multiple expansion that investors are pricing.\n",

    "## Section 3: How We Systematize This\n",
    "\n",
    "To move from narrative to algorithm, we construct a **Productivity Regime Indicator** that captures whether the macro environment is conducive to deflationary (1990s-style) or inflationary (current) productivity transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indicator synthesizes three sub-signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Globalization Pressure** — proxied by China export/producer prices. Falling = deflationary globalization; rising = inflationary deglobalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real Yield Stability** — calculated as the volatility of real yields (nominal 10Y minus trailing PCE inflation). Low and stable = benign financial conditions; high and volatile = tightening or fiscal stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Labor Cost Pressure** — proxied by US unit labor costs. Falling = labor market slack (1990s immigration + globalization); rising = structural labor scarcity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component is z-scored against its own history and combined into a composite score bounded between -1 and +1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Regime Score} = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{z_{\\text{china}} + z_{\\text{real\\_yield\\_vol}} + z_{\\text{ulc}}}{3}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Score near **-1**: Deflationary productivity regime (1990s). Globalization suppressing prices, yields stable, labor cheap.\n",
    "- Score near **0**: Neutral.\n",
    "- Score near **+1**: Inflationary productivity regime (current). Deglobalization, volatile yields, expensive labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then examine whether this indicator has predictive power for equity multiple changes.\n",

This deflationary tailwind allowed the Fed to remain accommodative even as growth accelerated, which in turn justified equity multiple expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The current environment is structurally inflationary.** The Regime Indicator has been persistently positive since 2021. All three components — globalization pressure, real yield volatility, and labor costs — are working against the disinflationary transmission mechanism that made the 1990s special.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CAPE is mispriced relative to the regime.** Our stress test shows that if equity multiples tracked the productivity regime as they have historically, the S&P 500 would be materially lower. The current pricing implies investors are betting on a 1990s-style regime that the data does not support.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **AI stocks are especially vulnerable.** Semiconductor stocks have re-rated to levels that assume AI will deliver 1990s-style productivity gains to the *entire economy*. But the macro regime means those productivity gains — even if they materialize — will be offset by higher input costs, tighter labor, and less accommodative monetary policy.\n",

    "### What Could Prove Us Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "Intellectual honesty requires stating the conditions under which this thesis fails:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI productivity gains are so large they overwhelm inflation.** If AI reduces service-sector costs by 30%+ within 3-5 years (not just tech sector), the inflationary regime could flip. We think this is unlikely on that timeframe.\n",
    "- **A major geopolitical de-escalation.** If US-China tensions resolve and globalization resumes, the China CPI component would reverse. Possible but not the base case.\n",
    "- **A deep recession.** A severe downturn would crush demand and labor costs, temporarily restoring a deflationary regime. But this would also destroy earnings, so multiples wouldn't necessarily expand.\n",
    "- **Fiscal consolidation.** If the US undertakes meaningful deficit reduction, real yield volatility would fall. There is no political constituency for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positioning Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "For a systematic macro portfolio:\n",
    "- **Underweight long-duration equities** (high P/E growth stocks, including AI beneficiaries) relative to consensus\n",
    "- **Favor real assets and pricing-power equities** that benefit from nominal growth\n",
    "- **Stay structurally short duration** in fixed income — the regime does not support a return to 1990s-style real yield compression\n",
    "- **Monitor the Regime Indicator for regime change signals** — a sustained move below 0 would challenge this thesis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*The core message is simple: the market is pricing AI as if it will recreate the 1990s. But the 1990s were not about technology — they were about a deflationary world order that no longer exists. What the market is really betting on is not AI, but a return to globalization. And that bet, in our view, is wrong.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Methodology Note:** All indicators use trailing data only (no look-ahead bias). The Regime Indicator uses expanding-window z-scores, meaning each observation is scored relative to all prior data available at that point. The CAPE-regime regression uses the full sample for illustration; in a production system, this would use rolling out-of-sample estimation.\n",
